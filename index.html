  <h1>D'AULAIRES' BOOK OF GREEK MYTHS</h1>
  <h3> by Eric Lemaire </h3>
    <div id="bodyleft">
      <p>
      This chart represents the relationships between the 12 major gods and goddesses of Mt. Olympus.<br> Here you see all the myths of these gods and the gods that are mentioned within these myths.<br> It tells a story of not only the gods and their importance, but their relationship with others.<br>
      <br>In D'Aulaires' Book of Greek Mythology, each god is given their own myth.<br>However, often times, other gods will appear in these myths because they share a relationship or <br>affiliation. This visualization is designed to explore those relationships and see what connections <br>we can derive from these stories  and who appears with the most frequency, such as Zeus,<br> and those with less frequency, like Hestia, who doesn't have a myth at all.
